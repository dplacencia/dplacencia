# Daniel Placencia Alvarez — Cloud, DevOps & AI Infrastructure Engineer

Welcome - and thanks for stopping by.
This repository powers **dplacencia.com**, my personal website and technical hub where I mix Cloud Architecture, DevOps, AI infrastructure…and the occasional over-engineered idea 😜

## 🔧 Tech Stack

This site is built with a modern, minimal, and high-performance stack:

- **Astro** — Static-first framework for fast, lightweight sites
- **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first CSS for clean and responsive design
- **Cloudflare Pages** — Global CDN, CI/CD, SSL, and zero-maintenance hosting
- **GitHub Actions** — Linting, build previews and CI workflows

The site deploys automatically on every push to `main`.

## 🌐 Live Website

You will find my professional services, architecture insights, DevOps tools, and curated technical content.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Repository

- Host my public website
- Centralize my technical identity
- Serve as a reference implementation for building static websites with Astro and Cloudflare
- Demonstrate clean repo structure, CI/CD discipline, and engineering standards

If you're exploring how to build a clean static site with Astro, feel free to reference or fork the project.
